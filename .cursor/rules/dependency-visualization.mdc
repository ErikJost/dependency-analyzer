# Dependency Visualization Guide

This rule provides guidance on using the visualization tools included in the dependency analyzer.

## Available Visualizations

The project includes several visualization options:

1. [dependency-visualizer.html](mdc:dependency-visualizer.html) - Basic force-directed graph visualization
2. [enhanced-dependency-visualizer.html](mdc:enhanced-dependency-visualizer.html) - Advanced visualization with filtering
3. [dependency-list-view.html](mdc:dependency-list-view.html) - Tabular view of dependencies

## Accessing Visualizations

After analyzing dependencies with the `analyze_dependencies` tool, visualizations can be accessed by:

1. Opening the HTML files directly in a browser
2. Using the endpoint: `http://localhost:8000/visualize/{project_id}`

## Visualization Features

### Force-Directed Graph

The force-directed graph provides:

- Interactive node dragging
- Hover tooltips with file details
- Color coding by file type
- Zoom and pan controls

### Configuration Options

The visualizations can be customized through URL parameters:

```
?filter=component&highlight=auth&exclude=test
```

- `filter`: Filter nodes by type (component, util, hook)
- `highlight`: Highlight specific modules or files 
- `exclude`: Exclude patterns from visualization
- `layout`: Change layout algorithm (force, radial, hierarchical)

## Exporting Results

Visualization data can be exported in several formats:

1. JSON: For programmatic processing
2. CSV: For spreadsheet analysis
3. PNG/SVG: For documentation

## Integration with Cursor

When using with Cursor, the dependency visualizer provides context about:

1. Import relationships between files
2. Module coupling and cohesion
3. Code organization patterns
4. Potential refactoring opportunities
