# Docker Image Hygiene Rule

When building a new Docker image for the dependency analyzer MCP server, always remove any old containers that use the previous image before starting a new one. This prevents clutter and resource waste from having multiple containers and images running simultaneously.

## Steps

1. **Stop and remove the old container before running a new one:**
   - Use the following commands before starting a new container:
     ```bash
     docker stop DependencyMCP || true
     docker rm DependencyMCP || true
     ```
   - This ensures that the container named `DependencyMCP` is not left running or in a stopped state.

2. **Build the new image:**
   - Example:
     ```bash
     docker build --no-cache -t mcp/sdk-minimal -f Dockerfile.sdk_minimal .
     ```

3. **Start the new container with the updated image:**
   - Example:
     ```bash
     docker run -d --name DependencyMCP -v /Users/erikjost/data:/data mcp/sdk-minimal
     ```

## Rationale
- Prevents confusion and resource waste from having multiple containers with the same purpose.
- Ensures the running container always uses the latest image.
- Keeps the Docker environment clean and manageable.
