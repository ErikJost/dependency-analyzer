# Next Steps for Dependency Analyzer MCP Server

## Current State
- The project now includes a fully working MCP server using the official Python SDK (`sdk_minimal_server.py`).
- All required tools are exposed and compatible with Cursor and other MCP clients.
- Docker workflow is streamlined with Dockerfile.sdk_minimal (located in the project root).
- Orphaned files are now moved to the `archived_orphan` folder in the project root. If a file with the same name exists, a dash and the next available number is appended (e.g., `file.md`, `file-1.md`, `file-2.md`). No files are deleted.

## Immediate Next Steps

1. **Replace Mock Logic**
   - Implement real dependency analysis in each tool (currently returns mock data).
   - Integrate with your actual code analysis scripts or libraries.

2. **Persist Project and Analysis Data**
   - Move from in-memory storage to persistent storage (e.g., files, database) for projects and analysis results.
   - Ensure data is retained across server restarts.

3. **Add Error Handling and Validation**
   - Validate tool arguments and provide clear error messages.
   - Handle edge cases and invalid input gracefully.

4. **Expand Test Coverage**
   - Add unit and integration tests for all MCP tools.
   - Test with Cursor and direct JSON-RPC requests.

5. **Document API and Tool Usage**
   - Update documentation for each tool, including input/output examples.
   - Provide usage guides for developers and AI agents.

6. **Integrate with CI/CD**
   - Set up automated builds and tests for the MCP server and Docker image.
   - Optionally, run dependency analysis as part of your CI pipeline.

7. **Community and Contributions**
   - Encourage contributions via issues and pull requests.
   - Share improvements with the MCP SDK community if relevant.

## Longer-Term Ideas
- Add support for more languages and frameworks.
- Enhance visualization and reporting features.
- Integrate with additional AI agent platforms.
- Optimize performance for large codebases.
